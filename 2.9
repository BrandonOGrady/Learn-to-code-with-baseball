Say we hava a dict: pitcher_info = {'starter': 'Kershaw', 'throws_right': False}
a) how would you change 'starter' to 'Joe Kelly'?
b) Write a function toggle_throws that takes a dict like pitcher_info, turns 'throws_right' to the opposite of whatever it is, and returns the updated settings dict.

Answers:
A) pitcher_info['starter'] = 'Joe Kelly'
B) 
def toggle_throws(pitcher):
    pitcher['throws_right'] = not pitcher['throws_right']
    return pitcher

toggle_throws(pitcher_info)
