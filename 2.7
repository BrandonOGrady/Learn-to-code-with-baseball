Write a function commentary_plus that works like commentary above but can also handle averages passed in decimal form (e.g. 0.275). Note it should still be able to handle non-decimal (275) too.)

answer:
def commentary_plus(x):
    if x < 1:
        x = int(x*1000)
    if x >= 300:
        return f'{x} is a good ave'
    else:
        return f"{x}'s not that good"
commentary_plus(.100)
commentary_plus(400)
