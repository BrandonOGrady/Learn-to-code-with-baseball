Write a function commentary that takes in a batting average (without the deciaml) and returns a string '333 is a good ave' if the number is >=300 or '275's not that good" other wise.

def commentary(x):
    if x >= 300:
        return f'{x} is a good ave'
    else:
        return f"{x}'s not that good"

commentary(333)
